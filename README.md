# SFMEDM
Space-efficient feature maps for string alignment kernels

## Overview
SFMEDM is a feature maps for string alignment kernels. SFMEDM takes a set of strings and outputs feature vectors for those strings. Those outputs can be used for solving string classification and regression problems using linear SVMs. Please see our papers (Y.Tabei et al., ICDM'19) for more details. 

## Quick start
cd src  
make  
./sfmedm --input_file=../dat/dat.txt  --output_file=out.txt

## Input file format
    Each line of input file is a class label (integer) followed by a string as follows, 
    1 AAQFVAEHGDQVCPAKWTPGAETIVPSL
    1 AFQFTDKHGEVCPAGWKPGSDTIKPDVEKSKEYFSK
    1 AIHHTQVNANEVCPVDWQPGQKTITPSSKSARGFFET
    0 AFQYVETHGEVCPANWTPDSPTIKPSPAASKEYFQK
    0 SLQLTANYSVATPADWKEGEDVVVSNSIKTEDIPSKFPKG

Please see ./dat/dat.txt for an example.

## Output file format
    Each line of output file is a class label (integer) followed by a feature vector in the LIBSVM format where feature is represented as a pair of dimension and value as follows, 
    1 1:0.306572 2:0.176107 3:0.221853 4:-0.275284 5:0.0186437 6:-0.353061 7:-0.332309 8:0.12071 9:-0.241722 10:0.258013 11:0.0684519 12:-0.346864 13:-0.309075 14:-0.171676 15:0.150164 16:0.320079

The order of class labels and feature vectors in the output file is the same as that of class calbels and strings in the input file. 
The output file can be used for an input for LIBLINEAR (https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/liblinear/).
