# SFMEDM
Space-efficient feature maps for string alignment kernels

##Overview
SFMEDM is a feature maps for string alignment kernels. SFMEDM takes a set of strings and outputs feature vectors for those strings. Those outputs can be used for solving string classification and regression problems using linear SVMs.
